April 18, 21: Trying to learn about GitHub. I was watching a tutorial by Corey Shafer about Regex with Python and I
tried to download a file from the description page of that tutorial (snippets.txt). I downloaded an HTML file instead 
and it won't open, so I have to learn about GitHub AND how to download working copies of HTML pages.
